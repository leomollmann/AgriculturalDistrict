A New Civilization VI Specialty District

## The Agriculturar District
Sometimes you settle a city with a bunch of hills or no hills at all, this kinds of cities struggle with the unballance of growth or food. The agricultural district can handle these problems not by the lame way being a better food market, but with adjancencies and tile improvements buffs to fullfil one of these two roles. The core idea is to choose between boosting food or production by contradictory adjancencies. The balance comes in this district being not better than a Industrial zone cluster nor than a farm plateu, but used to boost production in cities that you cannot build great industrial zones or boost food in cities that doesn't even have a farm triangle spot available to be placed. Yes it makes cities much stronger, but it doesn't help directly in any specific victory condition, fullfilling a more generic role. You dont see Incas steamrolling every game with those juicy terrace farms, or *feed the world* belief pulling food from thin air.

### Food Role
By placing this district adjecent to the city center, it provides +2 food. In addition to that, +2 food for each adjecent aqueduct, commercial hubs and entertainment complexes. The idea behind that is to give a more dynamic way to build adjacencies with unusual districts, for example, aqueducts used to boost industrial zones, entertainment complex used to boost culture or the unused commercial hub adjacency (if you are not playing Mali or Germany), creating a creative and dynamic way to generate food, by building compact districts clusters ideal in hilly cities with a river.
