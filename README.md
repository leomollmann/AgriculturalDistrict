# AgriculturalDistrict
A New Civilization VI Specialty District

## The Agriculturar Center District
Sometimes you settle a city with a bunch of hills or no hills at all, this kinds of cities struggle with the unballance of growth or food. The agricultural center can handle these problems not by the lame way being a better food market, but with adjancencies and tile improvements buffs to fullfill one of these two roles. The core idea is to choose between boosting food or production by contradictory adjancencies. The balance comes in this district being not better than a Industrial zone cluster nor than a farm plateu, but used to boost production in cities that you cannot build great industrial zones or boost food in cities that doesn't even have a farm triangle spot available to be placed. Yes it makes cities much stronger, but it doesn't help directly in any specific victory condition, fullfilling a more generic role. You dont see Incas steamrolling every game with those juicy terrace farms, or *feed the world* belief pulling food from thin air.

## Food Role
By placing this district adjecent to the city center, it provides +2 food. In addition to that, +2 food for each adjecent aqueduct, commercial hubs and entertainment complexes. The idea behind that is to give a more dynamic way to build adjacencies with unusual districts, for example, aqueducts used to boost industrial zones, entertainment complex used to boost culture or the unused commercial hub adjacency (if you are not playing Mali or Germany), creating a creative and dynamic way to generate food, by building compact districts clusters ideal in hilly cities with a river.

## Use Cases
These use cases to demonstrate how it changes the game plan, but not break it, allowing more dynamic cities cooperations, better strategic border cities or offshore settlements. All of that, of course, assuming no iron or horses ruin you day.
### Single city, maximum adjacency

In this case, the agriculturar district have its maximum adjacency, provinding +8 food, and adding the other districts we have all the ingredients to grow population on a city with housing from the aqueduct, ameneties from the entertainment complex and gold to cover upkeep from the commercial hub.

### City pair, balanced approach

In this second example, two +8 production industrial zones were planned, but we also could fit two +8 food agriculutal districts, +4 and +6 gold commercial hubs, and that allowed a +4 culture theater square to be placed. Every District have its role preserved, but to go beyond 8 adjacency in the agriculutal districts, we need to sacrifice industrial zone adjacency.

### City pair, maximum adjacency

In this thrid exaple, two +10 food agriculutal districts were the focus of these cities, leaving only a very sad +3 production industrial zone placements. This setup is perfect for hilly cities who lack food, but have plenty of mines.

### Conclusion
This distric adds another whole dimenton of possibilites in district placements, fullfilling a simmilar role to the lame feed the world belief holy sites (with are kind of impossible to get on deity difficulty). Distirct adjacency is my favorite mechanic in Civ 6, thats maybe why i like to play as Dutch, Australia and Japan, and dont even get me started on larger city clusters.
